# Sliding Window

The sliding window technique can be applied to Strings and Arrays. It helps to solve the problem with `O(n)` time complexity otherwise will take `O(n^2)` or `O(n^3)`.

The space complexity could be `O(n)` .There would be one more data structure generally to hold the data in a given window.

There are two types of sliding windows:

* Fixed-size sliding window
* Variable Size sliding window
