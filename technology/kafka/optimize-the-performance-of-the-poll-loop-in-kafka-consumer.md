# Optimize the performance of the poll loop in Kafka Consumer

<mark style="color:yellow;">It is important to note that the poll loop is a blocking operation, meaning that it will block until it receives a batch of messages from the broker or a timeout occurs</mark>. Therefore, the poll loop must be run in a separate thread or event loop to avoid blocking the main application thread.

To optimize the performance of the poll loop, you can tune various configuration parameters such as the batch size, fetch size, and poll timeout. By setting these parameters appropriately, you can balance the trade-off between latency and throughput and achieve the desired level of performance for your Kafka consumer application.

To optimize the performance of the poll loop in a Kafka consumer, you can consider the following tips:

1. **Increase the batch size:**\
   To increase the batch size in a Kafka consumer, you can use the `max.poll.records` configuration parameter. This parameter determines the maximum number of records returned in a single call to `poll()` method. By default, it is set to 500 records. You can increase this value to increase the batch size and reduce the number of network round-trips required to fetch messages.\
   \
   Here’s an example of how to set `max.poll.records` to a larger value:

<pre class="language-java"><code class="lang-java"><strong>Properties props = new Properties();
</strong>props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("group.id", "test-group");
props.put("enable.auto.commit", "true");
props.put("auto.commit.interval.ms", "1000");
props.put("max.poll.records", "1000"); // Set batch size to 1000 records

KafkaConsumer&#x3C;String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer&#x3C;>(props, new StringDeserializer(), new StringDeserializer());
consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("test-topic"));

while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords&#x3C;String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord&#x3C;String, String> record : records) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
    }
}
</code></pre>

The batch size determines the maximum number of messages that the consumer will fetch in a single poll request. By increasing the batch size, you can reduce the number of network round-trips required to fetch messages, which can improve the overall throughput of the consumer. However, increasing the batch size too much can also increase the latency of the consumer.

{% endhint %}

**2. Tune the fetch size:**

To tune the fetch size of a Kafka consumer, you can use the `fetch.max.bytes` configuration parameter. This parameter determines the maximum number of bytes that the consumer will fetch in a single request. <mark style="color:yellow;">By default, it is set to 50 MB</mark>.

To optimize the fetch size, you can adjust this parameter to a value that balances the trade-off between network latency and memory usage. A larger fetch size can reduce the number of requests required to fetch a set of records, thereby reducing network overhead. However, a larger fetch size also means that more memory will be required to buffer the fetched records.

Here’s an example of how to set `fetch.max.bytes` to a larger value:

```java
props.put("fetch.max.bytes", "10485760");  // Set fetch size to 10 MB
```

The fetch size determines the maximum number of bytes that the consumer will fetch in a single poll request. By increasing the fetch size, you can reduce the number of network round-trips required to fetch messages, which can also improve the overall throughput of the consumer. However, increasing the fetch size too much can increase the memory usage of the consumer.

**3. Reduce the poll timeout**:

<mark style="color:yellow;">The poll timeout determines how long the consumer will wait for messages before returning an empty response. By reducing the poll timeout, you can make the consumer more responsive to new messages, which can reduce the overall latency of the consumer</mark>. However, reducing the poll timeout too much can also increase the number of empty responses, which can reduce the overall throughput of the consumer.

```java
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100)); // Set poll timeout to 100 milliseconds
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
    }
}
```

**4. Use asynchronous processing**:

If your message processing logic is CPU-bound or involves I/O operations, you can consider using asynchronous processing techniques such as threading or non-blocking I/O. By processing messages asynchronously, you can reduce the amount of time that the poll loop is blocked, which can improve the responsiveness and throughput of the consumer.

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        executorService.submit(() -> {
            processRecord(record); // Process the record asynchronously
        });
    }
}

public void processRecord(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
    // Process the record
    System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
}
```

**5. Use parallel processing:**

If your message processing logic can be parallelized, you can consider using multiple threads or processes to process messages in parallel. By processing messages in parallel, you can take advantage of multiple CPU cores and increase the overall throughput of the consumer.

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("group.id", "test-group");
props.put("enable.auto.commit", "true");
props.put("auto.commit.interval.ms", "1000");

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props, new StringDeserializer(), new StringDeserializer());
consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("test-topic"));

int numThreads = 10;
int batchSize = 100;
List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> records = new ArrayList<>();

while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> batchRecords = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : batchRecords) {
        records.add(record);
    }
    if (records.size() >= batchSize) {
        List<List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>>> partitions = Lists.partition(records, batchSize / numThreads);
        List<Callable<Void>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
        for (List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> partition : partitions) {
            tasks.add(() -> {
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : partition) {
                    processRecord(record); // Process the record
                }
                return null;
            });
        }
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);
        try {
            executorService.invokeAll(tasks);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle the exception
        } finally {
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
        consumer.commitSync();
        records.clear();
    }
}

public void processRecord(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
    // Process the record
    System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
}
```

**6. Monitor the consumer performance:**

It is important to monitor the performance of the consumer regularly to detect any bottlenecks or issues that may affect its performance. You can use tools such as JConsole or Kafka consumer lag monitoring tools to monitor the consumer performance and identify any performance issues.

By applying these tips, you can optimize the performance of the poll loop in a Kafka consumer and achieve the desired level of throughput and latency for your application.
