## Problem

## Intuition

* This is a very nice problem as one require multiple concepts. Like
  * **Lowest Common Ancestor**
  * **DFS** : _Tree Traversal and Backtracking_ (to get Path b/w nodes)
* First let us make couple of observations and note it down :
  * How to get shortest distance/path b/w two node in Binary Tree?
    * We need to find closest point(from nodes), where path from root to nodes intersect
    * This is nothing but the **LCA**(Lowest Common Ancestor) of two nodes.
  * Now, if we move from **start node to LCA node**, which direction we will follow : `U(up)` , `L(left)` or `R(right)` ?
    * Here we can surely say since LCA always lie above the node, so we will move in upward direction.
    * And there can also be a case when **start node itself is LCA**, so no need to worry in this case.
* Now coming back to our problem, we need to get shortest path from `start -> destination` , or
  *   in other words path from

      ```rust
        "start -> LCA" + "LCA -> destination"
        
        -> But we cannot find "start -> LCA" directly. i.e from bottom to up
        -> What we can do instead is first find top to down path 
        		i.e "LCA -> start" , using normal tree traversal algo
        -> and then convert it such that we move in upward direction. (Observation: 2)
        
      ```
* Thus, putting all these together. Lets write a **step-by-step** algorithm to get directions :
  1. First of all find the LCA node of `start` and `destination`.
  2. Then we need to get path from `lca_to_start` and from `lca_to_destination`.
  3. To get path from `root -> node` as a string, we will use `traverse()` function.
     * In this we simply do a simple **DFS** ( kind of pre-order traversal)
     * First explore left path, if node is found. Then return true.
     * Otherwise backtrack and explore right path.
  4. Now that we have both paths, we will convert all chars in `lca_to_start` to `U`, since we will move upward.
  5. At last, concatenate both strings and return combined path.
*   Lets see this through an example :

    ```rust
      Given : start = 3, destination = 6
      			
      					  5   ---> LCA(3,6)
      					/   \
      				       1     2
      				      /     /  \
      	        start <---	    '3'   '6'    4
      					   ^
      					   |
      				   destination
      				   
      -> So here node '5' is LCA of start(3) and dest(3)
      -> path from lca_to_start = '5 -> 1 -> 3' = "L L"
      -> path from lca_to_dest = '5 -> 2 -> 6' = "R L"
      
      Also, since we know that shortest path from 
      	# start-> destination = 'start -> LCA' + 'LCA -> destination'
      	
      So, we need to convert (reverse) `lca_to_start` = "U U" , as we move in upward direction
      
      Therefore, final path = "U U" + "R L" = "U U R L"
    ```

## Time Complexity

N -> Total Number of node

O(N) -> LCA

O(N) -> Traverse from LCA to start

O(N) -> Traverse from LCA to dest

{% hint style="info" %}
O(N) + O(N) + O(N) = 3 O(N) = O(N)

Final is `O(N)`
{% endhint %}

## Space Complexity

N -> Total Number of node

O(h) -> LCA stack space&#x20;

O(N) -> In worst case, there is a skewed tree and the path from left most node to right most // node is O(N)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
O(h) + O(N) = O(N)

Final is `O(N)` for skewed tree
{% endhint %}

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
