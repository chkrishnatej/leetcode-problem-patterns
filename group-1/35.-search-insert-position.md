# 35. Search Insert Position

## Problem

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/" %}

## Intuition

Since we need to find the position at which an element needs to be inserted, we need to find the lower bound [cn-implement-lower-bound.md](cn-implement-lower-bound.md "mention")

## Time Complexity

`O(log n)`

## Space Complexity

`O(1)`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
  /**
   * This method finds the appropriate insertion position for a target value in a sorted array.
   *
   * The insertion position is the index where the target element should be inserted
   * to maintain the sorted order of the array. If the target is already present in the array,
   * the index of the first occurrence is returned.
   *
   * @param nums The sorted integer array to search in.
   * @param target The target value to search for.
   * @return The index where the target should be inserted.
   */
  public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {

    // Initialize low and high pointers for binary search
    int low = 0;
    int high = nums.length - 1;

    // Loop until the low pointer crosses the high pointer (search space exhausted)
    while (low <= high) {

      // Calculate the middle index to check
      int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

      // Check if the target is found at the middle index
      if (nums[mid] == target) {
        // Target found, return the middle index (first occurrence)
        return mid;
      } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
        // Search left half for the insertion position (target should be inserted before)
        result = mid;
        high = mid - 1;
      } else {
        // Search right half for the insertion position (target should be inserted after)
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    }

    // Target not found in the entire search space
    // Return the potential insertion position (based on the last comparison)
    return result;
  }
}

```
