## Problem

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/" %}

## Intuition



## Time Complexity



## Space Complexity



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Time Complexity: O(log n);
        // Space Complexity: O(1), auxillary space, no extra space is used
        

        int low = -1, high = nums.length;
        // We are trying to find the first valid position so we are trying to minimize
        // the problem

        // When the answer is found, the low + 1 and high will be adjacent to each other
        // Low represents the last invalid position where target could be found or inserted
        // High represents the first valid position where target could be found or inserted
        while(low + 1 < high) { 
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            // Check if the current "mid" number is greater or equal to target
            if(greaterOrEqualTo(nums[mid], target)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }

    private boolean greaterOrEqualTo(int num, int target) {
        return num >= target;
    }
}
```
