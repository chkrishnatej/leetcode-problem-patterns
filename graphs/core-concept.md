# Core Concept

### Types of problems that can be asked

1. BFS, DFS (Standard algorithm)
2. 0-1 BFS (Modified algorithm) , (Multisource BFS)
3. Dijsktra (Standard and modified)&#x20;
4. Bidirectional search (to lower branching factor , A\* is an overkill)&#x20;
5. Graph Coloring (Bipartite graph)&#x20;
6. Topological Sort (Standard and modified algorithm)
7. Minimum Spanning Tree&#x20;
8. Floyd Warshell
9. NP hard problems ( using bitmask)
10. Graph bridges (time of visiting node)
11. Disjoint union set
