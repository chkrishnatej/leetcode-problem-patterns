# 70. Climbing Stairs

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/" %}

This is a 1D array dynamic programming problem. It can be solved in both Bottom-Up and Top-Down approach.&#x20;

This is a good problem to get started on the basics of 1D DP problems.

## Problem Description

The question is in how many ways we can reach the $$n^{th}$$step. The valid moves are at any given step is 1 or 2 moves. And need to make sure that we do not go out of bounds



## Solution

### Top Down

In the above recursion tree, we see there are duplicate computations

The dotted lines represent the duplicate computations. In DP, we optimize it by storing them in a cache, so we make sure we compute the value only once and rest of the calls for that function gets picked up from cache.

```java
```
