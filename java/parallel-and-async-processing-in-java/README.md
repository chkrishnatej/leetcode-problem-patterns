# Parallel and Async Processing in JAVA

## What is difference between parallel and async processing?

In computing, we often want to make things faster or avoid waiting too long for a task to finish. That's where async and parallel processing come in. They help but in different ways.

### Async Processing

* **What it Does**: Lets your program keep running without stopping for something else to finish first. Imagine sending a text and being able to do other things while waiting for a reply, instead of just waiting.
* **Best For**: Tasks like loading a webpage, asking for data from a database, or anything else where your program needs to wait for answers from somewhere else.
* **Benefits**: Keeps your app snappy and responsive, avoiding those moments where it seems frozen because it's waiting on something.

### Parallel Processing

* **What it Does**: Breaks a big task into smaller pieces and works on all the pieces at the same time, like a group of friends cleaning a house faster together than one person could alone.
* **Best For**: Tasks that require a lot of computing power, like analyzing big data, editing photos or videos, or doing complex math.
* **Benefits**: Makes big tasks finish faster by using more of your computer's brainpower at once.

## What is concurrency?

When to Use Concurrency

* **Scalability:** Helps systems manage more tasks or data smoothly as they grow.
* **Responsiveness:** Systems can deal with user inputs and run background tasks at the same time, making everything feel quicker.
* **Efficiency:** Using concurrency means making the most out of available resources by keeping downtime low.

#### Advantages of Concurrency

Concurrency is when a computer can do many tasks at once. It's like having several cooks in a kitchen, each doing a different job but working together. This way, a system can handle many operations at once, weaving them together to get things done faster and more efficiently, without needing to finish one task to start another.



## Relationship between concurrency, async and parallel processing?

Concurrency, async (asynchronous programming), and parallel processing are closely related concepts in the world of computing, each with a distinct role in enhancing system performance and efficiency. However, understanding their relationship is crucial to leveraging their benefits optimally.

* **Concurrency**: Refers to the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks at the same time. Concurrency is more about dealing with lots of things at once (i.e., handling multiple tasks at the same time in a single core by quickly switching contexts).
* **Async (Asynchronous Programming)**: Asynchronous programming is a method of concurrency that allows tasks to start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, without waiting for each one to finish before starting the next. It's like starting to cook the next dish while the current one is still in the oven, maximizing use of time.
* **Parallel Processing**: Parallel processing involves performing multiple operations at the exact same time, usually by utilizing multi-core processors. This approach is like having multiple cooks in the kitchen all preparing different parts of a meal simultaneously.

**Relationship Summary**: Concurrency is the broad concept of running multiple tasks in the same period, which can be achieved through asynchronous programming or parallel processing. Asynchronous programming is a technique to facilitate concurrency, focusing on the efficiency of task execution without necessarily running tasks simultaneously. Parallel processing, on the other hand, is a form of concurrency that achieves simultaneous task execution by utilizing multiple processing units. Understanding these concepts and their relationship is key to optimizing the performance of complex systems.

## Parallel Execution frameworks in Java

Java offers several frameworks and APIs for enabling parallel execution, which can significantly boost the performance of applications by leveraging multi-core processors. Here are some of the prominent ones:

#### 1. **Java Concurrency API**

Introduced in Java 5, the Concurrency API (part of `java.util.concurrent` package) provides tools for creating and managing threads, thread pools, and executing concurrent tasks. Key classes include `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, and `Future`.

#### 2. **Fork/Join Framework**

Available from Java 7, the Fork/Join Framework is designed for work that can be broken down into smaller pieces and executed in parallel. Utilizing a divide-and-conquer approach, it leverages the `ForkJoinPool` class to manage a pool of worker threads.

#### 3. **Parallel Streams**

Java 8 introduced Streams, a key abstraction that supports functional-style operations on streams of elements. By invoking the `parallelStream()` method on a collection, you can process elements in parallel, utilizing the Fork/Join Framework under the hood for splitting and managing tasks.

#### 4. **CompletableFuture**

Java 8 also introduced `CompletableFuture`, an enhancement over the Future interface that supports lambda expressions, making it easier to write non-blocking asynchronous code. It allows the composition of multiple asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

Understanding and appropriately applying these frameworks and APIs can significantly improve the scalability and performance of your Java applications by fully exploiting modern multi-core processors.

## Async processing frameworks in Java

#### 5. RxJava

RxJava is a popular library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, and concurrent data structures. RxJava is heavily used in Android development but is also applicable to any Java application looking to handle asynchronous streams of data with ease.

#### 6. Spring WebFlux

Spring WebFlux is part of the Spring 5 framework, providing an asynchronous and non-blocking reactive programming model built over Project Reactor. It allows building scalable web applications with a functional style of programming, offering support for both server-side and client-side development. WebFlux is designed to work in an event-loop execution model, unlike the traditional servlet-based Spring MVC web framework, making it ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

By incorporating these async processing frameworks into your Java applications, you can achieve higher performance, better scalability, and improved application responsiveness. Each framework has its strengths and is suited to different types of applications, so choosing the right one for your project is crucial.
